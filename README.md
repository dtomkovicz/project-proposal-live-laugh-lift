Live, Laugh, Lift. - Daniel Tomkovicz

## What and Why?

I would like to build a workout creator/sharer web application that would allows users to generate their own workout plans into playable videos with sound. This will be done by selecting libraries of exercises with stock pictures that will be programmable in terms of length, reps, rounds, rest period between different exercises, etc. Using the user created plan, the app will generate the video for download, and users can string together various workouts into programs that can be shared with other users (with ratings), with the app tracking completion progress and which programs/exercises have been completed. The problem is people need to exercise, exercises are never one size fits all, so enthusiasts can easily make their own down to the exact second without any technical knowledge or editing capabilities. This is super important as our increasingly sedentary lifestyles are a big reason why my generation likely will be the first to not outlive their parents, getting just one more person to exercise would be worth it.

## For Whom?

For workout enthusiasts and perfectionists, people who have knowledge about exercise but can't find the perfect program to follow and want to create their own structure. This group will be the 'makers'. Other users can rate and review to find a program that someone else created without having to manually make any workouts at all, yet gaining access to a huge free open source library of workouts hand crafted by others.

## How?

Users will create accounts on the web app and make time and/or rep based workouts through a simple, easy to use workout builder. This builder assembles a mp4 video with the exact workout order, time/reps for each exercise, rest time between all different exercises, and number of rounds. This information combind with a library of images/looping videos (that is also make from a library of user-uploaded assets) demonstrating each workout to play at each different point of the video for the described duration. These workouts can be strung together into multiday programs, whether it be to rotate muscle groups or incorperate specific stretches on rest days. Users will also be able to share, rate, and review different programs and track their daily progress on a sort of calender that shows which workouts they have completed on which day.

## Scope

    This proposal hopefully has enough range such that it could would be doable to at least some extent in the semester. I tried to include as much as possible in broad stroke capabilities in this proposal, but for a bear bones version all that is totally necessary is a user log in database with a pre established library of pictures/looping videos of circa 25 exercises, the user interface to assember the parameters of the workout, and then the capability to build in the cloud and export to the user the full video of the workout. Programs, sharing, ,rating & reviewing and daily exercise tracking are all things the project could greatly benifit from and increase difficulty, but are not totally necessary for a working package.
